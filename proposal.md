# Magical Mayhem
  Magical mayhem is a legandary creature designed to give artists a little push in the right creative direction. 
  The idea is to have a code that randomly gives arists subject matters based on what they feel like drawing. If someone wants to draw a new character, the Mayhem will provide several different topics to lead the artist in the right direction. Need to study a specific part of the body for drawing? The Mayhem will give you a random choice for you to draw! 
# Features
  The Magical Mayhem essentially just gives you random words and random ideas to draw. There will be several lists that have topics like animals or people or even different aesthetics in case you dont know in what direction you want to go. By using the lists and random functions, as well as importing images, I should be able to make a simple randomizer game in Python.
