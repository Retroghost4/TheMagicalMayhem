# Magical Mayhem
  Magical mayhem is a legandary creature designed to give artists a little push in the right creative direction. 
  The idea is to have a code that randomly gives arists subject matters based on what they feel like drawing. If someone wants to draw a new character, the Mayhem will provide several different topics to lead the artist in the right direction. Need to study a specific part of the body for drawing? The Mayhem will give you a random choice for you to draw!

## Features
  The Magical Mayhem essentially just gives you random words and random ideas to draw. There will be several lists that have topics like animals or people or even different aesthetics in case you dont know in what direction you want to go. By using the lists and random functions, as well as importing images, I should be able to make a simple randomizer game in Python. 
## Challenges
  Reasonably the challenges of this would simply be importing the image of the creature into pygame, since I dont want this to be a simple randomizer. Another challenge I might run into is just making sure that the python file runs, and users can interact with the screen they are given. 
## Outcomes
  ### Ideal Outcome
    The ideal outcome would be that users can click on the options that the Mayhem gives them, and gives them a comprehensive creative idea. This means that users are almost given a sentence to build their own creative ideas from. 
  ### Minimal Outcome
    I simply want the program to give users a random word to spark their creativeness. Does not have to be a sentence but it should be something, like a word or a color. 
## Milestones
  1. Creating the art for the program
  2. Coming up with lists for the Mayhem to choose from, and creating those lists
  3. Coding the game window
  4. Adding the game options to click on certain things
  5. Finalizing the finish product
